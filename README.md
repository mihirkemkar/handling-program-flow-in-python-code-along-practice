### Project Overview

 The project undertakes the complex actions than the previous project. Here it demonstrates the advance use of for loops and if statements. We can always achieve any kind of solutions with these basic techniques in python. 


### Learnings from the project

 After completion of this project we learn the complex use of for, if, try - catch statements. We also take the coding to the next level. The indentation in python does gets complex with these codes. But with the clean technique of coding the errors can be minimized and code can be kept simple to work.
